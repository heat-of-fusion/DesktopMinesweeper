You can play this project now, but this project is still on development.

I'm optimizing the GUI system and ETC.

This project is developed for my display (3840X2160), so the program could perform bad in your Desktop.

I'll fix the problem when I'm free.

### Run

After installing the all packages, type ```python DesktopMinesweeper.py``` on the terminal.

The program would scan your desktop and automatically make the block grid.
